        The rich just got richer. Most at the top of the leader board had extra
        points on the Gators and they did not disappoint. After Florida took the
        opening play for a long TD run, Virginia held tough. The game never
        looked in doubt but turned out to be a good showing for the ACC runner
        up. We now have a three way tie at the top, a group of 5 not far behind
        and another group of 8 in the conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are still 4 teams in the red with GaDawg41 the base of the
        pyramid. She took the underdogs in three games yesterday with extra
        points and as they say in Mudville, the Mlighty Casey has struck out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Five games today and not one game between ranked teams. Imagine football
        on New Years Eve without a Bowl Series contest to keep you interested.
        You are all welcome. New Years Day will have some great contests,
        looking forward to those too. I do not expect a tie at the top after
        today's games. We could even have a new leader.

        What do you get when all the favorites win? You get a new leader.
        Clemson Billy takes over the top spot and Toilet Bowl Bound jumps into a
        4 way tie for second with two five point wins yesterday. Indians79
        dropped a few but has in his back pocket +5 on Louisiana in the Lending
        Tree Bowl. That may be a highly watched contest in some households. The
        Nittany Lions held on to beat a tough Memphis team, Notre Dame won
        handily, LSU in a laugher (I almost felt sorry for Oklahoma and question
        the sense of leaving the LSU starters in so long, just to set some
        records) and Clemson showing they belong, as we Tiger fans knew all
        along. The Clemson/Ohio State game was one for the ages, in doubt until
        the final 30 seconds and sets up the Championship Game that most entries
        predicted. 50 people have LSU playing Clemson and is a real wildcard in
        our final standings. We will cover the metrics of that game another day.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the NFL takes center stage today there are no bowl games scheduled.
        Monday brings us three average games starting with Western Michigan(29)
        vs Western Kentucky (41) , Mississippi State and Louisville almost an
        even pick, and California a 42-28 selection over Illinois. The evening
        contest and the Orange Bowl has hometown Florida a heavy favorite over
        ACC's Virginia Cavaliers. You will find a lot of extra points added at
        the Orange Bowl and if you didn't have 3 or 5 on the game and the Gators
        win as expected, you may drop a few spots.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our negative teams are down to 4, and just like the Oklahoma Sooners, we
        are all rooting for you.

        With a busy 5 game schedule there were quite a few perfect days to move
        people up in the standings. Indian79 is now tied for the lead as Mole
        made a big move with a +5 and a +3 yesterday. There is a 5 way tie for
        third place. Speaking of North Carolina, it is great to see Mack Brown
        back in the ACC and a strong NC program will raise the bar for the
        entire conference.
      </p>
      <p>
        We still have 13 teams in the negative, same as yesterday. The Air Force
        win drove 5 more to the red numbers on the last game. Today brings the
        long awaited playoffs to light as well as the Cotton Bowl (since when is
        it not played New Years Day??) and Penn State a 63-7 pick from our
        competitors. The Fighting Irish are a 56-14 pick over Iowa State (why
        couldn't they start this game at 2 pm?). For the big boys, LSU is a 69-1
        selection. There are MANY extra points on the Tigers. The Sooners get no
        respect and the penultimate game for Jalen Hurts has arrived. The
        Clemson Tigers are a 50-20 favorite in what will be the best game of the
        season to date in my humble opinion. There is a lot of Tiger love in the
        group, but the Carolina fans can't bring themselves to pick Dabo's boys.
        However the college football prognosticator LarkNation is picking a
        Tiger-Tiger finale. Should be a great finish for the day, I'll be
        watching.

        Our two games yesterday could be best described as bookend games. They
        couldn't have been more different. Miami could not manage a single point
        against Louisiana Tech and the Pitt - Eastern Michigan contest proved to
        be a great game to enjoy. Many placed extra points (me included) on the
        Panthers. Except for some late game "boys will be boys" moments and an
        ejection for the last play of the game it was loaded with comebacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indians79 maintains the lead, but not as large over Land Sports and
        Brees=GOAT followed closely by Clemson Billy and 5 other challengers. We
        are down to just 10 players in the negative and today may be the day
        everyone is back in the black. It is hard to pick the marquee game today
        with 6 bowls being played. My pick would be Texas A&M vs Oklahoma State
        The Aggies losses looks like a Top 10 ranking and I believe they are a
        good team. Most of the top 10 takes A&M, could be an SEC bias.
      </p>

        H U G E day ahead for those of you that do not have to work and can
        watch 14 hours of football.

        With a single game each day I thought it best to update these two
        together.
      </p>
      <p>
        No surprise as UCF dominated the Thundering Herd of Marshall in the
        heaviest extra point game of the season. If you did not place 5 points
        on the Golden Knights you lost ground. On Christmas Eve, the Hawaii Bowl
        was a close one that was worth watching until the very end with the
        Warriors scoring a late touchdown to close out the Cougars. If you have
        to lose a close bowl game, it is best to do it in Honolulu.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a plus 15 earned in the last three games, Indians79 vaulted to a
        big lead in the contest over Col. Forbin and also leads the contest with
        8 correct picks along with steamboat racing and FD Jackson. We still
        have 13 teams in the negative leading up to Day 5 and the Independence
        Bowl between Miami and Louisiana Tech ( the college home of Terry
        Bradshaw and Phil Robertson of Duck Dynasty). The Hurricanes are a 6
        point favorite for the 4 pm start. Miami is the popular pick with the
        top 5 all going Canes. the second contest has the Pitt Panthers against
        Eastern Michigan at 8 pm. The Panthers are the popular choice with many
        placing extra points on this one. Pitt has a tendency to play great
        teams well and average teams, well, not so good. The city of Pittsburgh
        wasn't too excited to go to Detroit for this one, but Coach Narduzzi
        with have his squad fired up.

        What's the difference between hometown1 and hometown2? Answer - 56
        places. They obviously to did confer on picks or purposely picked
        alternate teams. But that is what the contest is all about!
      </p>
      <p>
        With 6 games played and a few surprises, over two-thirds of the field
        was in negative points for a while. And with App State on the ropes
        early there were many nervous participants saying their "Bowl sheets are
        ruined!" But patience is the key.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a long day of football for many teams to watch for the first
        time. Only two ranked teams played with Boise State losing handily to
        Washington and App State playing a better second half. One year my
        selections were to take all the higher ranked teams as a winner, up to
        the top 100 teams. Don't do this, bad strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ten players have 6 correct picks giving them at least a sweet 16
        ranking. We are being led by the Group of 5. With no bowl games on
        Sunday as a deference to the NFL ( who did not reciprocate yesterday for
        some strange reason. BTW the Patriots win the AFC East for the 11th
        straight year) college bowl games do not play until Monday. Perhaps we
        should all watch the Gasparilla Bowl in protest instead of MNF. Very few
        are giving Marshall a chance as one of a handful of double digit
        spreads. As the sheets on the lower end of the standings say "Go
        Thundering Herd!"
      </p>

      <p>Well, Bowl Sheets!</p>
      <p>
        The Most wonderful time of the Year is here. Tree Lighting, Christmas
        Parade and the Bowl Series. What a tough start to the season. We have 69
        participants this time around. Thanks to all of you for playing! We had
        46 people correctly pick Buffalo in Game one. Of those 46, only 2
        people, PRobbins and Lakness Monster got game two correct.

        I know many of you spent a lot of time selecting teams, looking at
        sit-outs, strength of schedule, weather, expert picks. And many others
        have spent 2, 3 or even 4 minutes picking your teams. Every one except
        Nana has opted for the the full extra point values this year (sorry
        Nana, bad move) and several players have lost extra points also (sorry
        LarkNation).
      </p>
      <p>
        Today's full slate of games (five to be exact) will create some
        separation on the leader board. As an FYI, these updates will be on the
        Home Page of www.northaugustasports.com By selecting any players name,
        you can see all of their picks and extra points. I spent many hours
        deciphering this information to you in years past that is now available
        by virtue of Toasty Solutions, LLC. What a lifesaver! So glad I have a
        computer whiz for a partner in this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hometown 2 and Lil Mingo take the lead in Day One. Each used some extra
        point success to reach this peak of greatness and I hope the rest of you
        have a successful Day 2.
