        <p>Well, it is all over. Michigan wins the National Championship over Washington in the battle of the unbeatens.
          We had 68 entries into this year's contest. Thank you to all who entered! For the first time I recall we had
          to go to a tiebreaker to settle the important standings.</p>
        <p>For first place, Stormps Janley and Shake & Bake finished with 36 points each. Shake & Bake wins with a
          tiebreaker selection of Fiesta Bowl over Stormps pick of Mayo 51-41.</p>
        <p>Bryce W finished solo third with 34 points and Wintergreen Zyn Pouch alone in 4th with 32. Evan W finished in
          sole 5th with 30.</p>
        <p>For the coveted 15th place we had a 5 way tie for 13th.</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Ball Hawk17 finished 13th with their selection of Sugar Bowl (67 points)</li>
          <li> Pat Weaver finished 14th with Alamo Bowl prediction (62 points) </li>
          <li> Beach Rich captured 15th with Fiesta at 67 points (actual 51 points) FREE ENTRY 2024 </li>
          <li> Rev ended at 16th place with Fiesta at 72 points </li>
          <li> Go4Bronze stopped at 17th place with Fiesta at 82 points </li>

        </ul>
        <p>For last place we had another tiebreaker. Square Grouper and D Q Hawkeye both ended at -20.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>D Q selected Orange Bowl (66 points) to finish 67th</li>
          <li>Square Grouper chose Alamo (62 points) to capture the bottom spot.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Collectively we finished at 679 positive points. This is a meaningless stat, but one I had to share.</p>
        <p>We are working on a NCAA Basketball contest that is different from the usual. But I think you will like it.
          Start paying attention to the scores!</p>
        <p>That's All Folks!</p>

        <p>This two day update brings many changes to the standings. Our new leaders are Chip Stewart with a commanding
          6 point lead over Bryce Williamson and 10 over Shake and Bake. The 10 point bonus game "upset" of Boston
          College over SMU took down many people. Our contest collectively lost hundreds of points on that one game. An
          interesting stat I am going to follow is the overall standing by adding everyone's total. Today we stand at
          plus 43.</p>
        <p>15th place (reminder this position receives a free entry next year since this is our 15th year) is a two way
          tie between Uncle Ed and Paul Robbins. Both are hoping to move up the standings. There are many entries that
          have saved most of their extra point games for the next few days. It probably will not help FMFA as they have
          a firm hold on the bottom of the barrel.</p>
        <p>Four great games today favor Ole' Miss (even though Penn State is a slight favorite), Auburn, Georgia as the
          heavy favorite in the contest and a slight edge for Wyoming. The Georgia/FSU game will be an interesting one.
          With all the opt outs, is there enough cohesion on either side to predict a winner? As the Bulldogs fell from
          the mountain top, is there enough at stake to put FSU away early? Do the Seminoles have something to prove? An
          upset here will also skew the standings heavily.</p>
        <p>I watched the Cotton Bowl last night and noticed there was a grant given to teachers for $1000 per touchdown.
          Into the 4th quarter I believe it was 3-0. A couple late touchdowns by Missouri finally put some money back
          into education.</p>
        <p>Enjoy the day, and the football.</p>

        <p> Chip Stewart and Bryce Williamson are the current leaders after yesterday's games. The 10 point option had
          some winners, and some losers. There is no such game as a sure thing. Today offers the second opportunity for
          a
          big jump in the standings. Shake and Bake dropped to third after riding a 10 point win for the Hokies by
          following up with three losses. Bugman and D Q Hawkeye lead the correct picks with 18, but can only muster a
          27th and 51st spot on the leaderboard. Dylan K made a great night with 10 points, 3 three point wins, to move
          into a tie for 4th.</p>
        <p>Square Grouper finally has someone to look down at as last place is turning into a three team race with FMFA
          and Stan Cummings. It is results like this you are glad you have a team nickname, or sorry that you don't.</p>
        <p>There are 4 games today with SMU and Miami as popular picks. The last two games is a much more even split. As
          we move to the end of the year, more teams sound familiar to me. The cream of the crop is getting to play.</p>
        <p>Best of luck!</p>

        <p>We have a 3 way tie for the lead! Brandon Padilla, BwrsComebck#24natty and NIL Wannabee are all tied at 17.
          There is a 6 way tie for 4th place with Paul Robbins making a 10 point jump yesterday to move up the
          leaderboard. That is like an eagle on #13, birdie #14 and eagle on #15 at Augusta on a Saturday. Let's see if
          he can finish the job.</p>
        <p>There are 4 games on tap today. Virginia Tech, West Virginia and Louisville are the popular choices.
          Oklahoma State and Texas A&M are a closer split. Today also starts the 10 point game window. 6 entries went
          with Va Tech and 1 selected Tulane, 5 opted for WVU and 1 for North Carolina, Seven went with Louisville and 1
          for USC and 2 picked the Cowboys with a lone entry going to the Jimbo-less Aggies. This will be a wild finish.
          In contrast, 21 entries have 10 on the SMU Mustangs tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Square Grouper was briefly out of the cellar until he was caught by FMFA. There is a 6 way tie for 10th that
          includes the 15th place spot. DQ Hawkeye still has the most correct picks at 17.</p>
        <p>Enjoy the day!</p>

        <p>Elephant 123 is today's leader as we take an NFL recess. Their challenge is they have only one extra point
          game left and did not opt for the 10 point selection. Progress will be baby steps. BwrsComebck#24natty has a
          hold on second with NIL Wannabee and TNTsMom tied for third. A three way tie for the 15th spot has shrunk to
          Evan Waldhauer, Trevor West and Bryce Williamson.</p>
        <p>I took it on the chin yesterday, going 1-6 for the day. There were a few others that did not fare too well
          either. </p>
        <p>Negative totals now register 20 teams. Many have extra point games left in the bag including the awesome 10
          point game after Christmas.</p>
        <p>Square Grouper has a partner at the bottom with FMFA. They will each have teams to cheer for, but not the
          ones they selected. D Q Hawkeye has the most correct picks, 14 of 18. Bryce W has only 6 correct picks, but
          has a T13 standing to boast. He is 5 out of 6 in extra games.</p>
        <p>Merry Christmas to all! Minnesota, Texas State and Kansas are heavy favorites when we return on the 26th.</p>

        <p>Happy Festivus!</p>
        <p>The Georgia Tech win moved some new players to the forefront with Go4Bronze at the helm. Elephant 123 is
          followed closely by Pickture Perfect to round out the top 3. BwrsComebck#24natty has the best overall record
          with 10 correct picks, only missing the New Mexico Bowl. Square Grouper is starting to separate from the
          field, in the wrong direction, with a stronghold on the cellar position. An 11 way tie for the coveted 15th
          place finish is a toss-up, including yours truly. There are also 11 players under water in negative points. I
          hope today is a good day for everyone.</p>
        <p>A busy day of games with 7 contests on tap. South Alabama, Utah and San Jose State are the heavy favorites in
          our group. With football all day, it is going to be hard to finish Christmas shopping. Add the Steelers vs
          Cincinnati Bengals game at 4:30 today and I need the day of rest on Sunday. Expect a big shuffle of standings
          after today, too many options to cover.</p>
        <p>Enjoy!!</p>

        <p>I skipped a few days of recaps as I was out of town, but with only a game a day the changes are not drastic.
          Unless there has been a change in your standings!</p>
        <p>Go4Bronze is our new leader leading a foursome of contenders in a close chase. ANGC, Tom P, Not Pickture
          Perfect and Bryce W are tied for second with BRyce getting only 1/2 of the correct picks. This reinforces the
          need to get the extra point totals correct. Colonel Forbin 2001 has finally fallen from the perfect
          prognosticating by missing the Syracuse game. I didn't get a chance to watch that one but I believe UCF
          thought it was basketball by dropping 45 on the Orangemen.</p>
        <p>Square Grouper remains in the basement with a slight lead on Unbridled Enthusiasm. Only 10 players remain in
          the negative. My Christmas wish is for everyone to be in the black, don't disappoint me.</p>
        <p>The Gasparilla Bowl pits the Ramblin' Wreck of Georgia Tech against another Florida team. Hoping the ACC can
          gain some revenge on this one. Our group is a 40-28 pick on UCF. Kickoff is 6:30 pm, just in time to finish
          dinner and watch the entire game as Christmas weekend arrives. A Georgia Tech win would move Elephant 123 into
          the lead as the lone team to risk 5 points. They must be an alumnus.</p>
        <p>Get ready for another busy day on Saturday with 7 games to watch. I hope all your shopping is complete.</p>

        <p>In a wild finish, Western Kentucky won a nail biter in overtime to edge Old Dominion 38-35. WKU was done 28-0
          at one point, finally caught ODU, blocked a field goal in OT and kicked the game winner from 29 yards. With
          such a wide margin pulling for WKU, most did not lose any ground. However AGNC vaulted into a tie for the lead
          with a 5 point win and Square Grouper took a 3 point loss to remain in the cellar.</p>
        <p>Colonel Forbin 2001 remains perfect at 8-0 and still remains in the top 5. In tomorrow's game, there is an
          interesting spread in the Frisco Bowl with UTSA a heavy favorite over the Thundering Herd of Marshall. 84% of
          the field goes with UTSA and over half the field has extra points on the game. Elephant 123, Shells N Cheese
          and FMFA have 3 points on Marshall, everyone else, 32 people (myself included) choose extra on USTA as a 12
          point favorite. Remember, they have to play the game. Could be moving day for a handful of brave Marshall
          fans. Go4Bronze will take the lead with a UTSA victory.</p>
        <p>Eight entries have missed only one game and everyone has picked at least two winners. The coveted 15th place
          finish (for a free entry next year) is a very crowded field at this point. It is a bit too early to discuss
          this position.</p>
        <p>Until tomorrow...........</p>
        <p>Happy Bowl season</p>

        <p>Many thanks to Toasty Solutions for a great contest website with loads of information available. With all the
          things wrong with college football including playoff teams, NIL, Transfer Portal, we will concentrate on the
          fun side of Bowl Season and the players who will entertain us over the next few weeks.. </p>
        <p>Well, 68 entries in this year's contest! With seven bowl games played, it was the busiest day of the year and
          will share the same number of games with December 23. There were a few noteworthy accomplishments.</p>
        <p> Colonel Forbin 2001 brings an unblemished mark of 7-0 to Monday's game, being the only contestant to achieve
          it but only a sixth place position. Eight players have only missed one game. The other side of the spectrum
          has Unbridled Enthusiasm with just one correct pick and in a last place tie with Square Grouper. A whopping
          87% of the field took Florida A&M for the win while 76% went with App State for the loss. We do like to select
          local. Go4Bronze and Elephant 123 lead the way with 11 points and an 18 point lead on our cellar dwellers.
          They each loaded up early on extra point games, Go4Bronze hit three 3 pointers and Elephant 123 hit two 5
          pointers along with a 1-1 record on the 3's. Either way, a great start. College football prognosticator
          LarkNation always has his eyes on a top 5 finish. While discussing the game winner selection method, he
          thought using team colors, mascots and nicknames as dependable as watching the season unfold. He sits in a tie
          for 44th.</p>
        <p> We again have lots of family members and smaller contests in our contest for bragging rights. Sunday is a
          day of rest for an NFL breather. We return Monday for the Famous Toastery Bowl (What is that??) with 44 opting
          for Western Kentucky and 24 with Old Dominion (the school of female basketball star from NAHS Amari Young).
          ANGC can move into a tie for the lead with a WKU win as he has wagered 5 valuable points on this one. Square
          Grouper will have the basement alone with a WKU win as he has 3 on ODU.</p>
        <p> Happy Bowl Season!</p>
