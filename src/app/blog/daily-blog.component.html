        <p>In a wild finish, Western Kentucky won a nail biter in overtime to edge Old Dominion 38-35. WKU was done 28-0
          at one point, finally caught ODU, blocked a field goal in OT and kicked the game winner from 29 yards. With
          such a wide margin pulling for WKU, most did not lose any ground. However AGNC vaulted into a tie for the lead
          with a 5 point win and Square Grouper took a 3 point loss to remain in the cellar.</p>
        <p>Colonel Forbin 2001 remains perfect at 8-0 and still remains in the top 5. In tomorrow's game, there is an
          interesting spread in the Frisco Bowl with UTSA a heavy favorite over the Thundering Herd of Marshall. 84% of
          the field goes with UTSA and over half the field has extra points on the game. Elephant 123, Shells N Cheese
          and FMFA have 3 points on Marshall, everyone else, 32 people (myself included) choose extra on USTA as a 12
          point favorite. Remember, they have to play the game. Could be moving day for a handful of brave Marshall
          fans. Go4Bronze will take the lead with a UTSA victory.</p>
        <p>Eight entries have missed only one game and everyone has picked at least two winners. The coveted 15th place
          finish (for a free entry next year) is a very crowded field at this point. It is a bit too early to discuss
          this position.</p>
        <p>Until tomorrow...........</p>
        <p>Happy Bowl season</p>

        <p>Many thanks to Toasty Solutions for a great contest website with loads of information available. With all the
          things wrong with college football including playoff teams, NIL, Transfer Portal, we will concentrate on the
          fun side of Bowl Season and the players who will entertain us over the next few weeks.. </p>
        <p>Well, 68 entries in this year's contest! With seven bowl games played, it was the busiest day of the year and
          will share the same number of games with December 23. There were a few noteworthy accomplishments.</p>
        <p> Colonel Forbin 2001 brings an unblemished mark of 7-0 to Monday's game, being the only contestant to achieve
          it but only a sixth place position. Eight players have only missed one game. The other side of the spectrum
          has Unbridled Enthusiasm with just one correct pick and in a last place tie with Square Grouper. A whopping
          87% of the field took Florida A&M for the win while 76% went with App State for the loss. We do like to select
          local. Go4Bronze and Elephant 123 lead the way with 11 points and an 18 point lead on our cellar dwellers.
          They each loaded up early on extra point games, Go4Bronze hit three 3 pointers and Elephant 123 hit two 5
          pointers along with a 1-1 record on the 3's. Either way, a great start. College football prognosticator
          LarkNation always has his eyes on a top 5 finish. While discussing the game winner selection method, he
          thought using team colors, mascots and nicknames as dependable as watching the season unfold. He sits in a tie
          for 44th.</p>
        <p> We again have lots of family members and smaller contests in our contest for bragging rights. Sunday is a
          day of rest for an NFL breather. We return Monday for the Famous Toastery Bowl (What is that??) with 44 opting
          for Western Kentucky and 24 with Old Dominion (the school of female basketball star from NAHS Amari Young).
          ANGC can move into a tie for the lead with a WKU win as he has wagered 5 valuable points on this one. Square
          Grouper will have the basement alone with a WKU win as he has 3 on ODU.</p>
        <p> Happy Bowl Season!</p>
