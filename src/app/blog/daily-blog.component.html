        Our leader is GeorgiaAlltheWay who had a strong early showing and is
        keeping the pace into the busy Christmas week of games. The only blemish
        is the opening game loss of SC State. They are joined by 5 other entries
        of one loss but are at the top due to 6 extra point wins. To no one's
        surprise, they have Georgia going all the way.

        The only extra points on the Idaho Potato Bowl was Michelle's Winners,
        however she still remains at the bottom of the pile. A few more had some
        juice on UTSA to bunch the bottom of the standings.

        What better way to celebrate College football than the Hawaii Bowl on
        Christmas Eve between South Florida and San Jose State. It seems teams
        from Minnesota and Wyoming would have been better choices to appreciate
        the weather, but Hawaii is probably a step up for any team. Let Russ
        Cook, Treys Picks and CuTiger77 are close in a tie for second. There is
        a 5 way tie for 16th place and the coveted free entry for next year.
        This year's free entry went to Beach Happy, who changed his name to
        Beachrich and is wallowing in 56th. Local prognosticator LarkNation is
        climbing fast and poised to make a run this week.

        Enjoy your Christmas holiday! Our next update will be after the games on
        the 26th.

        Sam Houston State surprised a lot of people with their victory over
        Georgia Southern. Ohio, Florida and Notre Dame were popular choices for
        most.

        The leader board has a new top dog with GeorgiaAllTheWay at 21 points
        and among 8 entries that have missed only one game. Bogie and Hate the
        portal are in a close tie for second at 19 points. The 16th place
        finisher gets a free entry next year. There are currently 13 people tied
        for that spot. And being really bad at selecting winners can also pay
        off. Last place is a winner too and Michelle's winners (appropriately
        named) has a 4 point lead over Mommalak who really likes the Tigers
        today. Michelle's winners are banking on a Volunteer victory over the
        Buckeyes.

        Today's games bring the balance of the first round playoff games. All
        the higher seeds are popular choices in the contest with Penn State,
        Texas and Ohio State, in that order. The Nittany Lions have 38 extra
        point picks, 33 in the Texas/Clemson game and only 12 in the Buckeyes
        game. Interestingly, Clemson has 8 extra point selections, SMU has 5 and
        Tennessee only 2.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall the contest is 425 - 151 for a 73.8% success rate. Not too
        shabby!

        Bowl Season finally arrived. I must admit Saturday was a personally busy
        day for me and I watched little football. The SC State loss to Jackson
        State coupled with the South Alabama victory left 4 entries out to a
        jackrabbit start. A surprising 32 people laid extra points on the the
        Salute to Veterans Bowl. The positive extra points on a game always
        helps. ColFrbn2001, The Pook22, Big Bryce and Wolfcreek2 lead the early
        returns.

        71 brave souls have entered this year, another record. It seems about
        half that many Marshall players opted out of their bowl game against
        Army. As a result of the Covid years, we instituted a rule that any
        cancelled bowl games or games that had its participants changed after
        submission would simply be eliminated from the contest and any extra
        points associated with the game would be as if they never occurred. It
        is a tough pill to swallow as Army was a huge pick for people with a 10
        point risk, my entry included. Another reason the opting out of players
        and the portal is so bad for college football.

        We take an NFL break for a few days, returning for the Frisco Bowl
        between WVU and Memphis followed by Boca Raton and the LA Bowl the
        following day. Memphis is a popular pick on Tuesday with only
        ColFrbn2001 opting for the Mountaineers.

        Many thanks to all playing this year, especially the new ones. Welcome
        those LarkNation subscribers. I have a few entry fees outstanding. Let's
        get that cleared up please!
