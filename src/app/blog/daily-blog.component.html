        Bowl Season finally arrived. I must admit Saturday was a personally busy
        day for me and I watched little football. The SC State loss to Jackson
        State coupled with the South Alabama victory left 4 entries out to a
        jackrabbit start. A surprising 32 people laid extra points on the the
        Salute to Veterans Bowl. The positive extra points on a game always
        helps. ColFrbn2001, The Pook22, Big Bryce and Wolfcreek2 lead the early
        returns.

        71 brave souls have entered this year, another record. It seems about
        half that many Marshall players opted out of their bowl game against
        Army. As a result of the Covid years, we instituted a rule that any
        cancelled bowl games or games that had its participants changed after
        submission would simply be eliminated from the contest and any extra
        points associated with the game would be as if they never occurred. It
        is a tough pill to swallow as Army was a huge pick for people with a 10
        point risk, my entry included. Another reason the opting out of players
        and the portal is so bad for college football.

        We take an NFL break for a few days, returning for the Frisco Bowl
        between WVU and Memphis followed by Boca Raton and the LA Bowl the
        following day. Memphis is a popular pick on Tuesday with only
        ColFrbn2001 opting for the Mountaineers.

        Many thanks to all playing this year, especially the new ones. Welcome
        those LarkNation subscribers. I have a few entry fees outstanding. Let's
        get that cleared up please!
