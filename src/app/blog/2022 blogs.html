        <p>What a day! What a playoff! What a Bowl Series Contest!</p>
        <p>
          The two playoff games were classics. There were times that fans could
          have turned the game off because they seemed out of reach, only to
          have great comebacks and finished. I cannot offer any words that would
          do the games justice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our contest has a new player near the top, riding a wave of extra
          point wins. I Love Cracker Barrel has vaulted into 2nd just a point
          behind FFtron. They are the two highest correct picks along with an
          underperforming Bogie who lingers in 23rd place and is 5-4 in extra
          point games.
        </p>
        <p>
          With an NFL break today and no games on New Year's Day, Monday will
          offer some excellent games to watch. But some extra point games are
          being played for the leaders. Should be a fun one to watch.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the bottom, E's picks is leading Evan Waldhauer and Mommlak60 by 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mississippi State, LSU, Utah and USC are heavy favorites from our
          contest.
        </p>

        <p>HAPPY NEW YEAR!!</p>

          After a couple full days of games, the leader board is what I would
          call "fluid". A few past leaders are near the top and a few new ones
          are in the mix.
        </p>
        <p>
          FFtron and AIAF are out front with 31 and LNKSMAN and
          Death.Taxes,.Matt Painter are just two back. FFtron has 22 correct
          picks and 31-30 comes in at 21 to lead everyone. Mommalak60 and Hawk2
          are fighting for the basement. Hawk2 is in the conversation after
          putting 5 on the Longhorns last night.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were some GREAT games over the past two days. Wins by Oregon and
          Florida State had many of us sweating it out and some probably gave up
          early. The Ole' Miss loss hurt a lot of people as they were heavy
          favorites. ANother SEC team going to defeat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today UCLA is a 49-15 pick, NC State a 45-19 selection, Ohio and
          Wyoming a toss up, Notre Dame a slight favorite over South Carolina
          and Clemson a 49-15 favorite of the group.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several have 10 points on the Orange Bowl, it will be an interesting
          evening of football.
        </p>
        <p>Enjoy!</p>

          A 4 game bowl day had what you would expect, winners and losers! AL's
          Best Guess went -6 yesterday to fall into a tie for 9th. Our new
          leaders are FFtron who had a 4-0 day and a +10 and Square Grouper, who
          went +6 even though he was 2-2 on the day. Hawk2 rode a -6 into last
          place and a firm hold on the cellar. FFtron also has 17 correct picks,
          the best of the contest.
        </p>
        <p>
          22 games in is the halfway point but we will hit high gear with 3, 5
          and 4 games over the next 3 days. Today our group has no favorite in
          Duke/UCF with 32 picks for each, Arkansas a 48-16 favorite over
          Kansas, Oregon with the heaviest favorite of all at 60-4 and Ole' Miss
          a heavy pick at 52-12. Oregon has a heavy load of extra points going
          on them, we'll see if the ACC can hold its own and Mack Brown can come
          up with a surprise for the Ducks. There will be bright colors in this
          game as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          LarkNation has made the best of his extra point picks with only 12
          correct ones and a 5th place standing. Last year's defending champ,
          Zach Zanolli, has his work cut out for him in 19th. 14 sheets remain
          in the negative, perhaps today we can get that number into single
          digits.
        </p>
        <p>Enjoy!!</p>

          We have a new leader! Al's Best Guess has ridden some extra point
          magic to burst into the lead over a trio of followers. I must admit I
          did not watch much of the games and as an NFL fan I spent a bit more
          time there.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hawaii Bowl was exciting and today is one of the busier days of
          the contest. With 4 games played today, it feels more like Bowl
          Season. There are even a few top 20 teams on the schedule which makes
          everyone able to use a bit more knowledge to pick a winner.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a group, we favor East Carolina 43-21, Georgia Southern 51-13,
          Memphis 48-16 and Wisconsin by a slight 34-30 margin. Up to now, our
          tiebreaker of which game has the most points is the Celebration Bowl
          between Jackson State and NC Central at 75 points. We have 18 bowl
          games in and 25 to go. We are down to 11 players in the negative and a
          competitive contest between 4 sheets for the bottom spot. Seven people
          have 13 correct picks. Our leader has 5 big ones on Oklahoma State. If
          the Cowboys win it may be a difficult task to dethrone Al.
        </p>
        <p>Good luck to all!!</p>

        <p>Aloha!</p>
        <p>
          After so many cold and windy bowl games that have attracted very few
          people in attendance, today's game is the Hawaii Bowl between Middle
          Tennessee State and San Diego State, which will probably also have few
          in attendance. Hmmm, football or Waikiki Beach?? Our group must
          believe the weather won't be enough to make a difference for MTSU as
          we are going 53-11 for SDS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yesterday's games went as expected, although Houston got off to a
          rocky start and a deficit at halftime. Wake Forest also had their
          hands full early but went on to defeat Missouri 27-14, feeding the
          argument that the SEC and ACC are closer in talent than SEC fans
          admit. Wake Forest managed only a 6th place finish in their division
          but won a convincing game vs the Tigers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our standings had little change with Ticknor still at the top by 2
          over Al's Best Guess and Trevor West. Square Grouper is another two
          back in fourth. The bottom has a three way tie between Bryce's Big
          Winner, ThatCrepeLady and Elephant2005. Fourteen people are still in
          the negative, down two from the day before. Of the 16 bowl games
          played, eight people have guessed 12 correctly. This includes Bogey
          who can only claim a tie for 36th place and F Jackson with 11 picks
          and a stunning total of -4 in 55th place (he has lost every extra
          point game.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our leader is placing 5 points on the Aztecs today and a victory will
          give him a commanding lead going into Monday. There are no bowl games
          on Christmas Day, generally leaving Sunday for the NFL. But the NFL
          decided to play 11 games on Saturday and only 2 on Sunday. I also
          heard that YouTube TV has purchased the rights to NFL's Sunday Ticket,
          paying 2 BILLION dollars per year for 7 years. That is crazy money.
          Plus the NY Mets payroll is over $450M for next year, or almost $3M
          per game. Our athletes should be held to a much higher standard.
        </p>
        <p>Merry Christmas!! Come back for our Monday update.</p>

          After a heavily selected Baylor team went down to Air Force in the
          Armed Forces Bowl, the leaderboard continues to change. Ticknor now
          has a lead on AIAF...... by two and is creating some distance with the
          field. 31-30 and Biscuits remain the top prognosticators with 11
          correct selections. The other end of the horse has a 3 way tie for
          last between ThatCrepeLady, TigerfanTnT and Bryce's Big WInner. 16
          players remain in the negative, perhaps some expected outcomes today
          will lower that number.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yesterday's Armed Forces Bowl was one of the most frigid in history,
          yet I was amazed at how many players were in short sleeves. The RB
          from Air Force was an unstoppable weapon for the Falcons. I really
          liked the Under in this game, and if not for a 65 yard pass in the
          final minutes from an offense that sputtered all day, I would have
          been right. We call that a "Loser".
        </p>
        <p>
          The two bowls today are the Independence and Gasparilla. Our group
          favors Houston and Wake Forest heavily. The forecast is frigid in
          Shreveport and quite comfortable in Tampa Tomorrow heads to Hawaii
          where the bad weather is pretty nice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enjoy the prelude to Christmas and a couple bowl games because it is
          too late to shop and too cold to go outside.

          Creeping along with single or double game days doesn't allow for much
          change in the standings, unless you lose a multiple point game such as
          I did. Ticknor and Square Grouper are in the lead. Ticknor is riding a
          three game streak that included 13 points to get to the top and Square
          Grouper was on an 8 game winning streak until Western Kentucky stopped
          the positive points.
        </p>
        <p>
          With 13 bowl games in, 31-30 and Biscuits have 11 winners to lead the
          pack. Elephant 2005 has only 3 winners to date but is not in the
          cellar. That distinction belongs to TigerfanTnT. Fifteen of our 64
          entries are still in the negative. My hope is always there are none of
          these at the end of the contest. Defending Champion Zach Zanolli is in
          a tie for 36th, proving that winning two in a row is difficult. For
          all of you that selected Georgia to repeat, which is significant, best
          of luck.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today's game is the Armed Forces Bowl between Baylor and Air Force
          Bears against the Falcons. Our contest is going 52-12 Baylor and more
          than a handful of extra points on the line. Weather is 17 degrees and
          23 mph winds. Take the under (43.5). As a running back, I might want
          to get tackled to conserve heat.

          A busy Day Two of the Bowl Series had 7 games played. As expected, no
          one has a perfect slate and everybody has picked a few winners.
          Leading the way is AAIF.......... with the jackrabbit start of 17
          points and Square Grouper hot on the trail with 15. There are 3
          players that are 8 for 9 including GaGal4Ever, Katie Stewart and
          LouBest. LouBest has not opted for many extra point games, only
          tempting a few later in the contest. The key to winning is hitting
          these extra point games, or not losing them, so we will have to watch
          this entry closely.
        </p>
        <p>
          I must confess I did not watch as much football as I wanted to. As a
          group, most players put some points on Deion and Jackson State to win.
          That didn't work out too well but was an exciting game to watch. And
          many also liked the Golden Eagles of Southern MIss over Rice which
          worked out much better. Oregon State and Boise were also very popular
          picks and they did not disappoint. Florida didn't look too good to me.
          If you are a Gator Fan you have my sympathies.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the other end of the contest, Bryce's Big WInner and TigerFanTnT
          had rough starts and are the early favorites to claim the cellar. We
          still have many games to play.
        </p>
        <p>
          A light schedule for the next few days has the Myrtle Beach Bowl
          between the Marshall Thundering Herd and the Connecticut Huskies. Our
          group is going Marshall 56-8. Many of the leaders are going extra
          points on Marshall, but TigerFanTnT is going UConn. Hmmmmmm.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will limp away with sihgle games during the week. Expect another
          update after a few days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fun fact: Over 1600 players entered the Transfer Portal. It is hard to
          imagine any team has been immune to it, with the exception of the
          playoff teams. Those electing not to play boggles my mind. I don't buy
          the "Exhibition Game" opinion. Most teams have games that are there to
          pad their record. These games have more upside to me.

          Welcome to 64 contestants in the Bowl Series 2022/23! Thank you to all
          that are participating this year. 2/3 of our mailing list submitted
          and everyone will enjoy the 42 game schedule a whole lot more than
          those that didn't enter.

          Day 1 had 2 games that working stiffs had a hard time watching. They
          were both close contests and exactly half of the contest picked both
          games correctly. There are a surprising amount of people with extra
          points, mostly because UAB was supposed to beat Miami of Ohio by quite
          a bit. They did win and the second game ended on a busted pass near
          the 20 yard line UTSA needed to win. So Mighty Troy walked away with
          the second win of the contest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Saturday is the busiest day of the year with 6 games on the schedule.
          Only December 30, with 5 games on tap, approaches as many bowl games.
          If your name is LarkNation, you will find a way to watch them all. I
          hope everyone enjoys the weekend. There are also no games on New
          Year's Day since it is a Sunday.
        </p>
        <p>
          With 32 sheets perfect at this point, I wonder how many can say the
          same thing tomorrow evening. We have a lot of family entries. Welcome
          to the Radke group of 12 that joined us instead of having their own.
