          Yesterday's bowl games were like an oreo cookie. Dry on the outside
          and creamy in the middle. Two runaway victories by Maryland and
          Oklahoma with a great Clemson/Iowa State game. And today brings us 4
          games that will continue to hammer our brains with football until we
          need to go into protocol to survive the playoffs and New Year's Day.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have a new leader! Dabo's Dynasty has parlayed his love of orange
          to a 5 point victory to open a lead over John Ticknor and Clemson
          Billy H. A 4 way tie for 4th has plenty of people in striking
          distance. Early leader A Waller sits in T14 and Phil King can see the
          leader board at T8.
        </p>
        <p>
          I see a variety of extra points on Wisconsin and Michigan State as
          well as North Carolina.
        </p>
        <p>
          LarkNation has finally made it to level points. Boiler Up! has a solid
          hold of 49th. I am hoping every entry can get to positive points and
          the playoffs give that opportunity. A rainy day, after Christmas lull,
          waiting on New Years, it would be hard to find a better day to put
          your feet up, get some snacks, use up the remaining comp time you have
          accumulated and enjoy the next couple days of college football. And
          please, no more cancellations.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many "family contests" in the series. Just to have bragging
          rights is worth the pain of picking a bunch of losers. Keep the
          faith!!

        <p>Finally, a few games in one day to shake up the standings!</p>
        <p>
          John Ticknor used a 5 point Houston and a 3 point Air Force win to
          vault into the lead over a couple of Clemson fans, Dabo's Dynasty and
          Clemson Billy H. Rounding out the top 5 are Phil King and overtonj.
          Each of these contestants have 13 or 14 correct games. Extra points
          are needed, but the highest pick totals usually rule the day. DJ's
          Heisman Campaign is an exception, riding his 14 correct picks to only
          a 20th place in the standings. Ticknor has 7 extra point games left,
          saving the heavy artillery for the big boys.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lakness Monster did his best to get to 49th but Boiler Up! held on
          fast by going 0-6 and 3 cancellations in the last 9 games. Ouch HIs 3
          on the Hokies and 5 on the Sooners will be make or break.
        </p>

          Our contest received some nice props from the latest edition of
          LarkNation. If you enjoy college football, you need to get this
          newsletter. It is free of charge, has no sharing of emails, no
          advertisements and full of opinions and reporting on in-season college
          football. If you are interested in getting this next season, let me
          know and I will pass along your name. There will be a recap at the end
          of the Bowl Season you will not want to miss. BTW, the research he
          does generally has him in the top 5. So far this year, T32. But what
          has happened predictably this year?
        </p>
        <p>
          Enjoy today's games, a Cheez-It, Pinstripe and Alamo Day! And
          probabl;y with teams you have followed during the season.

          Phil King remains in the lead with a two point advantage over Dabo's
          Dynasty and Clemson Bill H. This triumphant group is followed by a six
          way tie for 4th. All of these entries remain in the hunt for Bowl
          Series superiority. There is also a 4 way tie for Mr. Irrelevant at
          -7.
        </p>
        <p>
          The news of the contest is becoming not the results but the
          cancellations. The Hawaii Bowl and Military Bowl were both canceled.
          And the Sun Bowl and Fenway Bowl followed suit. I also read Boise
          State has withdrawn from the Arizona Bowl. Per a previous recap, we
          are eliminating these games from the contest. The playoff teams have
          also posted a scenario on what to do for game cancellations. Our
          process will be to award points for games that a winner was
          determined. For example, if the Cincinnati/Alabama game is canceled
          because Alabama has decided not to play the game and Cincinnati
          advances, they will be declared the winner. Even in these strange
          times, I do not anticipate the playoffs being canceled. But anything
          can happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's hope all the remaining games occur. We have 5 games on tap for
          tomorrow and another 3 on Wednesday. We are now approaching the sweet
          spot of the Bowl Season. FYI, one of our contestants will be working
          the LIberty Bowl as a sound man, we may even get a glimpse of him on
          camera as his duties are on the field.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks everyone for your patience and I hope your Christmas season
          remains one with much joy and fun. Much more than my sheet is giving
          me. Enjoy these next two days of action!

        <p>A 2 day update brought to you this Christmas Eve.</p>
        <p>
          Phil King is at the top of the leaderboard after a strong showing and
          implies he spends way too much time watching college football. In a
          second place logjam are Colonel Forbin 2001, Dabo's Dynasty and
          Clemson Billy H. CuTiger77 lost a 5 pointer on Florida to take over
          the cellar dweller spot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although there is no prize for this, TnTKingsMom and BawlHawk4 have
          the most correct picks at 11. SillyJack, John Ticknor and MommaLak60
          have the highest possible points at 68 if they can run the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched most of the Florida/UCF game and believe an entire culture
          change needs to happen in Florida. The Gators were flagged with too
          many unsportsmanlike conduct penalties that enabled Central Florida
          (the second largest university in America by student population) to
          win in the fourth quarter. Trivia question: Who has the most
          registered students? Hint: They have already won a bowl game this
          year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only one game on the schedule tomorrow, the much anticipated Camellia
          Bowl with Ball State and Georgia State meeting. Which brings us to the
          game cancellations. I deem it unreasonable to include the Gator Bowl
          with a 5-7 Rutgers team taking place of Texas A&M against Wake Forest.
          The game will be removed from the contest. Those of you, or should I
          say us, that had extra points on the game will not be able to switch
          with another bowl game. We also have Hawaii bowing out of the Hawaii
          Bowl, forcing the Memphis Tigers to spend the day on Waikiki Beach.
          This will also be removed from the contest. I am most disappointed
          about not rooting against Jimbo Fisher.
        </p>
        <p>
          I appreciate the comments about how much some of you enjoy the contest
          and the recaps. Just our contribution to the love of college football.
          And so many games left to play.
        </p>
        <p>Merry Christmas everyone! Next update on the 26th.</p>
        <p>
          Trivia Answer - Liberty University with over 100K student population,
          quite a few on-line I presume.

          Gagal4ever has taken the lead! Going 2 for 2 yesterday and having the
          most correct picks at 9 has vaulted her into the lead over standings
          climber Phil King. A bevy of players are crowded in a 6 way tie for
          3rd. As we peck along the bowl schedule expect more of the 1 point
          selections until after Christmas. For those of you waaayyyyy out of
          the lead, you only need to hit the 10 point selection while those
          ahead of you do not. The problem is most people selected Ohio State.
          If you selected someone else, you can now start chanting "Go Utes!!" A
          20 point swing will do wonders for your squad.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did my research this year for my sheet, staying in the middle of the
          pack and going 0-2 yesterday. I guess reading LarkNation every week
          was not enough. There seems to have been no advantage to writing it
          either.
        </p>
        <p>
          Boiler Up! now has a firm hold on 49th with CuTiger77 and DavisN
          edging in front. ONly one game today in the Armed Forces Bowl, I
          always pick a military team. Go Black Knights!!

          Well for only one game on the schedule there was much movement on the
          standings board.
        </p>
        <p>
          The "Rabbit" A Waller has been caught! A 3 way tie for the lead will
          keep things interesting today. Uncle Ed is right on his tail and
          continues to have the most correct picks. Close behind is Gagal4ever
          in a tie for first and TnTKingsMom with 7 correct picks. However
          points is the name of the game with I Love Cracker Barrel also at the
          head of the class.
        </p>
        <p>
          CUTiger77 and Boiler Up! remain in a hot contest for 49th place, don't
          count either one of them out as they vie for the title I had last
          year. You will be in good company. Not many extra points are going
          today. But if my predictions are correct, and they usually are not,
          the Frisco Bowl (not to be confused with the Frisco Football Classic
          that sounds alot like the Washington Football Club) with San Diego
          State and UTSA should be a high scoring game. I plan on watching that
          one closely.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have received about a dozen yardage predictions for the National
          Championship Game. I will revisit this request as we approach the end
          of the contest for those who may be affected.

          An exciting day of college football as a quintet of entries chase the
          rabbit, A Waller, who has used his extra points quite well. Will he
          have enough to hang on for the rest of the contest? The other end of
          the standings has CUTiger77 and Boiler Up! looking where the view
          doesn't change much. Two entries have 7 correct picks, Uncle Ed and
          TnTKingsMom. The ability to pick the winners is a gift, or lucky, or
          both. Many had extra points on Liberty and cashed in nicely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well over half the field is still in negative territory. The goal,
          which was not met last year, was to have everyone in the positive.
          Yours truly won the prize for last place, an honor I am looking to
          avoid again. Two time defending champ Nelsons is in the middle with
          only 3 correct picks. I look for them to bounce back quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The contest will limp along over the next few days. No games today as
          we take an NFL Break. Only one afternoon game tomorrow and two on
          Tuesday.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a reminder, I am disappointed to say the tiebreakers for most of
          the entries were not saved in the system. So I am asking everyone to
          submit another tiebreaker, that is the total yards gained by both
          teams in the National Championship Game. Last year Alabama and Ohio
          State put up 962. Only two people have submitted a number so far. If
          you elect to not submit one and are tied, a submittal will beat a
          non-submittal. Two non-submittals will split the bounty.

          50 players have registered this season, thank you all! It should be a
          great contest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of us got off to a tough start. Only 7 people picked Middle
          Tennessee to win and many laid some extra points on Toledo, myself
          included. It was a high scoring contest in the Bahamas that I wasn't
          able to watch much of. A Friday noon start is a tough one for the
          working man/woman to catch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Game 2 turned out to be a high scoring game as well with Coastal
          Carolina outlasting Northern Illinois that had a very questionable
          ending. With 3 seconds to play, an incomplete pass did not stop the
          clock and NIU was denied a final chance to score and win.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Waller showed his early dominance with two extra point wins while
          CUTiger77 and Big C turned two losses into the cellar spot. Two time
          defending champion The Nelsons are a solid 2nd place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Saturday is the busiest Bowl day of the year with 8 (EIGHT!) games on
          the docket. I am guessing there will be some separation in the
          standings after Day 2.

        <p>
          I am disappointed to say the tiebreakers for most of the entries were
